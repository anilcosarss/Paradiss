# Hello everyone! ðŸ¤— 

## This is one of the my old projects.
 <br>

#### Inspried by a figma project.

#### The purpose of this project was first time I converted a figma desing to HTML , CSS code .  <br>  <br>  <br>

My achievements were:
- Understanding figma projects
- View figma variables turn into code

```
- ( Not a responsive project) ! 

```


```diff

```
